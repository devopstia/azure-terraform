## Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
- You must have an Azure Cloud account to follow with me for hands-on activities.
- You don't need to have any basic knowledge of Terraform. Course will get started from very very basics of Terraform and take you to very advanced levels
- From Azure cloud perspective, also for complex topics like Standard Load Balancer, Application Gateway, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, we first implemnt via Azure Portal and then automate them via Terraform. 

## Who are your target students?
- Infrastructure Architects or Sysadmins or Developers who are planning to master Terraform from Real-World perspective on Azure Cloud
- Any beginner who is interested in learning IaC Infrastructure as Code current trending tool Terraform 
- Anyone who want to implement IaC DevOps on Azure DevOps using Build and Release Pipelines
